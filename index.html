                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a dedicated 27-year-old web developer originally from Ireland, currently based in Athens, Greece. With a passion for web development and a specialization in branding and identity, I bring over a decade of experience in the tech industry. For the past 5 years, I have focused on leveraging my expertise as a HubSpot specialist, where I've successfully implemented CRM solutions and enhanced customer sites to drive business growth and client satisfaction.

                        My journey in web development has been marked by a commitment to delivering high-quality projects that not only meet but exceed client expectations. I thrive in dynamic environments where creativity and technical skills converge to create impactful digital solutions. Whether collaborating with teams or working independently, I am driven by a desire to innovate and refine my craft continually.

                        Beyond my professional achievements, I have also undertaken projects that showcase my ability to conceptualize and execute comprehensive branding strategies. These experiences have honed my skills in UI/UX design, front-end development, and backend integration, enabling me to contribute effectively to diverse project scopes.

                        Looking forward, I am eager to further expand my expertise in web development, explore new technologies, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of digital experiences.
